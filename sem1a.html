				SEMESTER I

		MAB1181 ALGEBRA, GEOMETRY AND CALCULUS      L T P C
							    3 1 0 4
<br>
 OBJECTIVES:
<br>

	The course is aimed at
		
		• developing the skills of engineering students in the basics of chosen topics of 
		  Mathematics that are imperative for effective understanding of engineering
		  subjects.

		• laying the foundation for learning further topics of Mathematics in higher
		 semesters in a graded manner.

		• enabling the learners to appreciate the important role of mathematical concepts
		 in engineering applications.
